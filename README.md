# Just-Java
Completion of Project from Udacity course: Android Development for Beginners

Simple android app to order coffee:
  - Takes user's name with a EditText view
  - Gives two CheckBox views for the option of Whipped cream and Chocolate
  - Buttons to increment/decrement the amount of cups of coffee
  - When order is pushed the app calculates the final price and sends out
    an intent to an email app. It prefills the details of the order summary
    in the body of the email. User just adds the recipient's email address.
    
Course taught me:
  - How to build layouts using XML
  - Use resource files to change the theme and make the app support multiple languages
  - Strengthened my skills in Object-Oriented programming by using Java to make
    the app interactive
  - Gave me insight into the Android framework
